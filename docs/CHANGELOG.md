## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - All changes are additive or fix existing contract violations

### Deprecations
- `QuestionRouter` export from `orchestrator/__init__.py` (use direct import from `orchestrator.question_router`)

### Required Actions
1. Run mapping validation at orchestrator startup: `loader = YAMLMappingLoader(); loader.load_and_validate()`
2. Update imports to include validation components if using startup validation
3. Ensure `execution_mapping.yaml` exists in `orchestrator/` directory for validation

### Compatibility
- Python 3.10+ required (dataclasses, typing enhancements)
- NetworkX required for DAG construction and cycle detection
- PyYAML required for execution mapping parsing
- All changes backward compatible with existing adapter contracts
